# TidalLock

TidalLock is a dynamic, secure, and user-centric web-based password input application. Drawing inspiration from the ever-changing nature of ocean tides, TidalLock revolutionizes digital password entry by enhancing security through innovation and user-friendly design.

## Features

### Dynamic Keypad

- **Enhanced Security**: The keypad layout changes every two seconds, mimicking the unpredictable nature of ocean tides and thereby preventing pattern recognition and smudge attacks.
- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the keypad both by clicking on the on-screen numbers and using their physical keyboard.

### Secure Password Setting

- **Custom Password**: Users set their own numeric password upon application load, with a constraint of up to four digits, ensuring a personalized and secure experience.

### Attempt Management

- **Limited Attempts**: The application allows a maximum of three attempts to enter the correct password, encouraging careful input while maintaining security.
- **Attempt Feedback**: After each incorrect attempt, a special animation is triggered, and the remaining attempts are displayed, keeping the user informed.

### Overlay System

- **Lockout Mechanism**: Upon exceeding the maximum number of attempts, an overlay is activated, preventing further input and enhancing security.
- **Reset Capability**: Users can reset the attempt count and re-enter the password by clicking the "Try Again" button on the overlay.

### Future Enhancements

- **Responsive Design**: Upcoming updates will include a fully responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility for better accessibility.
